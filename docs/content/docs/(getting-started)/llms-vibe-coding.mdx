EdgeStore has first-class support for Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI-powered IDEs.

## 1. llms.txt & llms-full.txt

EdgeStore provides an [llms.txt](/llms.txt) file that contains the links to each page in the documentation.

EdgeStore also provides an [llms-full.txt](/llms-full.txt) file that contains the whole documentation in a single markdown.

## 2. Copy Markdown

Every page in the documentation contains a "Copy Markdown" button that allows you to copy the markdown formatted content of the page, so you can directly use it in your LLM.

## 3. `.md` suffix

You can also just add a `.md` suffix to the end of the URL to get the markdown content of the page.

For example: [https://edgestore.dev/docs/quick-start.md](/docs/quick-start.md)

## 4. VibeStack CLI Support

EdgeStore supports [VibeStack](https://vibestack.app), which automatically adds framework-specific markdown instruction files to your project.

Just run this command in your project directory:

```package-install
npx vibestack@latest add https://edgestore.dev/vibe.json
```

This will add multiple markdown instruction files specific to your framework, making it easier for AI coding assistants to understand how to implement EdgeStore in your codebase.
