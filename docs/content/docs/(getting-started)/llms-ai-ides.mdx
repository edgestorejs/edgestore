description: Learn how to leverage EdgeStore with Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI-powered IDEs, including VibeStack CLI support.
---

EdgeStore makes it easy to work with Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI-powered IDEs in two ways:

## 1. llms.txt

EdgeStore provides an [llms.txt](https://edgestore.dev/llms.txt) file that contains all the relevant EdgeStore documentation structured to be directly fed into an LLM's context window. This makes it easier for LLMs to provide accurate assistance when working with EdgeStore.

## 2. VibeStack CLI Support

EdgeStore supports [VibeStack](https://vibestack.app), which automatically adds framework-specific markdown instruction files to your project.

Just run this command in your project directory:

```package-install
npx vibestack@latest add https://edgestore.dev/vibe.json
```

This will add multiple markdown instruction files specific to your framework, making it easier for AI coding assistants to understand how to implement EdgeStore in your codebase.
