# Express Adapter

Some apps are built with React on the frontend (e.g. using `create-react-app` or `vite`) and have an `express.js` backend.

You can also use Edge Store in these cases, even without using Next.js.

## Setup

### Install

Let's start by installing the required packages.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="npm" label="npm">

```shell
npm install @edgestore/server @edgestore/react zod
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="pnpm" label="pnpm">

```shell
pnpm add @edgestore/server @edgestore/react zod
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="bun" label="bun">

```shell
bun add @edgestore/server @edgestore/react zod
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">

```shell
yarn add @edgestore/server @edgestore/react zod
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Environment Variables

Then go to your [Dashboard](https://dashboard.edgestore.dev), create a new project and copy the keys to your environment variables.

```shell title=".env"
EDGE_STORE_ACCESS_KEY=your-access-key
EDGE_STORE_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
```

:::caution
Make sure you add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file. <br />
You don't want to commit your secrets keys to your repository.
:::

### Backend

Now we can create the backend code in our express app.

The example below is the simplest bucket you can create with Edge Store. Just a simple file bucket with no validation that will be accessible by anyone with the link.

You can have multiple buckets in your app, each with its own configuration.

```ts
import { initEdgeStore } from '@edgestore/server';
import { createEdgeStoreExpressHandler } from '@edgestore/server/adapters/express';
import bodyParser from 'body-parser';
import cookieParser from 'cookie-parser';
import cors from 'cors';
import express from 'express';

// --- EXPRESS CONFIG ---

const PORT = process.env.PORT ?? 3001;

const app = express();

/**
 * Your express app is probably running in a different port than your frontend app.
 * To avoid CORS issues, we should use the cors middleware.
 */
app.use(
  cors({
    credentials: true,
    origin: true,
  }),
);
/**
 * Edge Store uses cookies to store the context token.
 * We need to use the cookie parser middleware to parse the cookies.
 */
app.use(cookieParser());
/**
 * We need to have access to the json request body.
 * We can use the body parser middleware to parse the request.
 */
app.use(bodyParser.json());

// --- EDGESTORE ROUTER CONFIG ---

const es = initEdgeStore.create();

const edgeStoreRouter = es.router({
  publicFiles: es.fileBucket(),
});

export type EdgeStoreRouter = typeof edgeStoreRouter;

const handler = createEdgeStoreExpressHandler({
  router: edgeStoreRouter,
});

// --- EXPRESS ROUTES ---

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  console.log(req), res.send('Hello from server!');
});

// set the get and post routes for the edgestore router
app.get('/edgestore/*', handler);
app.post('/edgestore/*', handler);

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`âš¡Server is running here ðŸ‘‰ http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});
```

### Frontend

Now let's initiate our context provider in the frontend app.

```tsx title="src/lib/edgestore.ts"
// You can import it from the other project if it's just the type
import { type EdgeStoreRouter } from '../../../path/to/express-backend/src';
import { createEdgeStoreProvider } from '@edgestore/react';

const { EdgeStoreProvider, useEdgeStore } =
  createEdgeStoreProvider<EdgeStoreRouter>();

export { EdgeStoreProvider, useEdgeStore };
```

And then wrap our app with the provider.

```tsx {0, 4, 6} title="src/App.tsx"
import { EdgeStoreProvider } from '../lib/edgestore';

function App() {
  return (
    <EdgeStoreProvider basePath="http://localhost:3001/edgestore">
      {/* Rest of your app */}
    </EdgeStoreProvider>
  );
}
```

## Usage

To upload or use the other functionalities of Edge Store, you can look the main [Quick Start](../main/quick-start.mdx) guide. The usage should be the same.

## Limitations

:::caution
For Edge Store to work properly in your deployed production app, Your frontend and backend should be in the same domain.

If you are deploying to Vercel, you can take a look at the [Rewrites settings](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/rewrites). In case you are using Apache or Nginx, you can setup a reverse proxy to make sure your frontend and backend are in the same domain.
