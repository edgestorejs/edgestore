# Hono Adapter

Some applications are built with React on the frontend (e.g. using `create-react-app` or `vite`) and have a `hono` backend.

You can use EdgeStore in these cases, even without using Next.js.

## Setup

### Install

Let's start by installing the required packages.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="npm" label="npm">

```shell
npm install @edgestore/server @edgestore/react zod hono
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="pnpm" label="pnpm">

```shell
pnpm add @edgestore/server @edgestore/react zod hono
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="bun" label="bun">

```shell
bun add @edgestore/server @edgestore/react zod hono
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">

```shell
yarn add @edgestore/server @edgestore/react zod hono
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Environment Variables

Then go to your [Dashboard](https://dashboard.edgestore.dev), create a new project and copy the keys to your environment variables.

```shell title=".env"
EDGE_STORE_ACCESS_KEY=your-access-key
EDGE_STORE_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
```

:::caution
Make sure you add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file. <br />
You don't want to commit your secret keys to your repository.
:::

### Backend

Now we can create the backend code in our Hono app.

The example below is the simplest bucket you can create with EdgeStore. Just a simple file bucket with no validation that will be accessible by anyone with the link.

You can have multiple buckets in your app, each with its own configuration.

```ts
import { initEdgeStore } from '@edgestore/server';
import { createEdgeStoreHonoHandler } from '@edgestore/server/adapters/hono';
import { serve } from '@hono/node-server';
import { Hono } from 'hono';
import { cors } from 'hono/cors';

// --- HONO CONFIG ---

const PORT = process.env.PORT ?? 3001;
const app = new Hono();

/**
 * Your Hono app is probably running in a different port than your frontend app.
 * To avoid CORS issues, we should use the cors middleware.
 */
app.use(
  '*',
  cors({
    // Change this to your frontend origin for better security
    origin: (origin) => origin,
    credentials: true,
  }),
);

// --- EDGESTORE ROUTER CONFIG ---

const es = initEdgeStore.create();

const edgeStoreRouter = es.router({
  publicFiles: es.fileBucket(),
});

export type EdgeStoreRouter = typeof edgeStoreRouter;

const handler = createEdgeStoreHonoHandler({
  router: edgeStoreRouter,
});

// --- HONO ROUTES ---

app.get('/', (c) => {
  return c.text('Hello from Hono server!');
});

// Route for EdgeStore
app.all('/edgestore/*', handler);

// Start the server
serve(
  {
    fetch: app.fetch,
    port: Number(PORT),
  },
  (info) => {
    console.log(`âš¡Server is running here ðŸ‘‰ http://localhost:${info.port}`);
  },
);
```

### Frontend

Now let's initiate our context provider in the frontend app.

```tsx title="src/lib/edgestore.ts"
// You can import it from the other project if it's just the type
import { type EdgeStoreRouter } from '../../../path/to/hono-backend/src';
import { createEdgeStoreProvider } from '@edgestore/react';

const { EdgeStoreProvider, useEdgeStore } =
  createEdgeStoreProvider<EdgeStoreRouter>();

export { EdgeStoreProvider, useEdgeStore };
```

And then wrap our app with the provider.

```tsx {0, 4, 6} title="src/App.tsx"
import { EdgeStoreProvider } from '../lib/edgestore';

function App() {
  return (
    <EdgeStoreProvider basePath="http://localhost:3001/edgestore">
      {/* Rest of your app */}
    </EdgeStoreProvider>
  );
}
```

## Usage

To upload or use the other functionalities of EdgeStore, you can look at the main [Quick Start](../main/quick-start.mdx) guide. The usage should be the same.

## Limitations

:::caution
For EdgeStore to work properly in your deployed production app, your frontend and backend should be in the same domain.

If you are deploying to Vercel, you can take a look at the [Rewrites settings](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/rewrites). In case you are using Apache or Nginx, you can set up a reverse proxy to make sure your frontend and backend are in the same domain.
