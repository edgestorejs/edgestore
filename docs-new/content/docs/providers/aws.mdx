description: Learn how to use your own AWS S3 bucket or S3-compatible services like Minio with EdgeStore using the AWS Provider.
---

You can also use the EdgeStore package with your own AWS S3 bucket. You might want to do that in case you have strict company policies that require you to have all the data in your own AWS account.

You can also use the AWS Provider with other S3 compatible storage services like [Minio](https://min.io/).

By using this provider, you will be able to use most of the basic features of EdgeStore. However, for some of the more advanced features like access control with protected files, you will have to create your own infrastructure and logic from scratch.

## Installation

You need to install some peer dependencies to use this provider.

```package-install
@aws-sdk/client-s3 @aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner
```

Then you can set the provider in the router.

```ts
import { initEdgeStore } from '@edgestore/server';
import {
  createEdgeStoreNextHandler,
  type CreateContextOptions,
} from '@edgestore/server/adapters/next/pages';
// [!code ++]
import { AWSProvider } from '@edgestore/server/providers/aws';
import { z } from 'zod';

// ...

export default createEdgeStoreNextHandler<Context>({
  // [!code ++]
  provider: AWSProvider(),
  router: edgeStoreRouter,
  createContext,
});
```

## Options

```ts
export type AWSProviderOptions = {
  /**
   * Access key for AWS credentials.
   * Can also be set via the `ES_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` environment variable.
   *
   * If unset, the SDK will attempt to use the default credentials provider chain.
   */
  accessKeyId?: string;
  /**
   * Secret access key for AWS credentials.
   * Can also be set via the `ES_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variable.
   *
   * If unset, the SDK will attempt to use the default credentials provider chain.
   */
  secretAccessKey?: string;
  /**
   * AWS region to use.
   * Can also be set via the `ES_AWS_REGION` environment variable.
   */
  region?: string;
  /**
   * Name of the S3 bucket to use.
   * Can also be set via the `ES_AWS_BUCKET_NAME` environment variable.
   */
  bucketName?: string;
  /**
   * Custom endpoint for S3-compatible storage providers (e.g., MinIO).
   * Can also be set via the `ES_AWS_ENDPOINT` environment variable.
   */
  endpoint?: string;
  /**
   * Force path style for S3-compatible storage providers.
   * Can also be set via the `ES_AWS_FORCE_PATH_STYLE` environment variable.
   * Defaults to false for AWS S3, but should be true for most S3-compatible providers.
   */
  forcePathStyle?: boolean;
  /**
   * Base URL to use for accessing files.
   * Only needed if you are using a custom domain or cloudfront.
   *
   * Can also be set via the `EDGE_STORE_BASE_URL` environment variable.
   */
  baseUrl?: string;
  /**
   * Secret to use for encrypting JWT tokens.
   * Can be generated with `openssl rand -base64 32`.
   *
   * Can also be set via the `EDGE_STORE_JWT_SECRET` environment variable.
   */
  jwtSecret?: string;
  /**
   * Optional function to overwrite the S3 key (object path) for uploads.
   * This function receives the EdgeStore bucket name, fileInfo and the default S3 key
   * and should return the desired S3 key string.
   */
  overwritePath?: (args: {
    esBucketName: string;
    fileInfo: FileInfo;
    defaultAccessPath: string;
  }) => Promise<string> | string;
};
```

## Overwriting S3 Object Keys

By default, the same logic used for generating the path for the EdgeStore Provider is used for the AWS Provider. However, sometimes you might want a cleaner path for the S3 objects that matches your use case.

For that, you can use the `overwritePath` option.

```ts
// ...
const handler = createEdgeStoreNextHandler({
  createContext,

  provider: AWSProvider({
    // [!code ++:4]
    overwritePath: ({ defaultAccessPath }) => {
      // `publicFiles/_public/123/test.png` -> `123/test.png`
      return defaultAccessPath.split('/_public/')[1];
    },
  }),
  router: edgeStoreRouter,
});
```

If you are removing the `_public` folder from the path like in the example above, you might also want to disable the dev proxy in the `createEdgeStoreProvider` function.

```ts
const { EdgeStoreProvider, useEdgeStore } =
  createEdgeStoreProvider<EdgeStoreRouter>({
    disableDevProxy: true,
  });
```

## Using with Minio

You can use the AWS Provider with Minio or other S3-compatible storage providers by setting the `endpoint` and `forcePathStyle` options.

```ts
provider: AWSProvider({
  endpoint: 'http://localhost:9000', // can be set via the `ES_AWS_ENDPOINT` environment variable
  forcePathStyle: true, // can be set via the `ES_AWS_FORCE_PATH_STYLE` environment variable
}),
```
