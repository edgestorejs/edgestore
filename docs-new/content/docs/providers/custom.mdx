# Custom Provider

You can also create a custom provider for a different storage solution or just a different implementation for the existing providers.

You can use the [EdgeStore Provider](https://github.com/edgestorejs/edgestore/blob/next/packages/server/src/providers/edgestore/index.ts) as a reference implementation.

If you build a provider that you believe could be useful for others, please consider contributing it to the EdgeStore project by opening a pull request.
